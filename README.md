To install: npm i
To run: npm run start

Click the dots on the grid to add (up to 15) characters
Every beep a new 'random steps' cycle starts for the members.
Mind... you may have to wait a bit for the first member
returns on stage, because of the timer / interval cycle.
Working on that...

css fat legs bug in chrome is fixed!
(new) members appear on the dot clicked in the grid
(new) reposition on window resize
hovering over the character halts the character 
clicking the character freezes the character
clicking oh head = head shake

(noisy) timed soundeffects! 
Added stacked layers (floors)
Added texture gradients
Added more animated walks
Click on character puts it in manual navigation mode (WIP) (see console)

Used Webpack to compile (Still WIP)
If anyone is interested let me know
I put the source on github

todo: 
add 'loading...' screen / modal
limit the max simultaniously played sounds...
manual navigation
show waiting queue / onstagequeue members
add 'settings' panel to tweak the settings
better control of the z-axis... / 
Independent animation of members cast-shadows... Jump! ;-)
